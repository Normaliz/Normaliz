# ChangeLog

## [3.1.4] 2017-01-01

-- a better implementation of \verb|Approximate| and its use in the inhomogeneous case,
-- Option Symmetzrize that produces symmetrized input for and runs nmzIntegrate and runs on it,
-- QNormaliz, a version of Normaliz using coordinates in an extension of $\QQ$ (estricted to convex hull computations and triangulation),
-- further automatic choices of algorithmic variants.
