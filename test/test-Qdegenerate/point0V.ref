Real embedded number field:
min_poly (a^2 - 2) embedding [1.4142135623730950488016887242097 +/- 7.86e-32]

1 vertices of polyhedron
0 extreme rays of recession cone
1 support hyperplanes of polyhedron (homogenized)

embedding dimension = 1
affine dimension of the polyhedron = 0 (maximal)
rank of recession cone = 0 (polyhedron is polytope)

size of triangulation   = 1
resulting sum of |det|s = 1

dehomogenization:
1 


volume (lattice normalized) = 1
volume (Euclidean) = 1
