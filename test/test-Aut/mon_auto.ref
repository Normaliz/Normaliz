3 Hilbert basis elements
2 support hyperplanes

embedding dimension = 2
rank = 2 (maximal)
external index = 2
internal index = 1
original monoid is integrally closed in chosen lattice

grading:
1 1 
with denominator = 2


Monoid automorphism group has order 2 (possibly approximation if very large)
Automorphisms are integral
