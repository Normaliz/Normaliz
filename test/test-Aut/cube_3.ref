8 vertices of polyhedron
0 extreme rays of recession cone
6 support hyperplanes of polyhedron (homogenized)

dual f-vector orbits:
1 1 1 1 1 

embedding dimension = 4
affine dimension of the polyhedron = 3 (maximal)
rank of recession monoid = 0 (polyhedron is polytope)

dehomogenization:
0 0 0 1 


volume (lattice normalized) = 6
volume (Euclidean) = 1

Euclidean automorphism group has order 48 (possibly approximation if very large)
Integrality not known
