4 vertices of polyhedron
0 extreme rays of recession cone
4 support hyperplanes of polyhedron (homogenized)

embedding dimension = 3
affine dimension of the polyhedron = 2 (maximal)
rank of recession monoid = 0 (polyhedron is polytope)
internal index = 40

dehomogenization:
0 0 1 


Rational automorphism group has order 8 (possibly only approximation)
Automorphisms are not integral
