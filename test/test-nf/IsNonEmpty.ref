Real embedded number field:
min_poly (a^2 - 5) embedding [2.236067977499789696409173668731 +/- 6.37e-31]

2 vertices of polyhedron
0 extreme rays of recession cone
2 support hyperplanes of polyhedron (homogenized)

1 excluded faces

embedding dimension = 2
affine dimension of the polyhedron = 1 (maximal)
rank of recession cone = 0 (polyhedron is polytope)

dehomogenization:
0 1 


Semiopen polyhedron is nonempty
