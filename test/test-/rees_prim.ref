8 Hilbert basis elements
5 generators of integral closure of the ideal
6 extreme rays
5 support hyperplanes

embedding dimension = 4
rank = 4 (maximal)
external index = 1
internal index = 1
original monoid is not integrally closed in chosen lattice

size of partial triangulation   = 1
resulting sum of |det|s = 5

No implicit grading found

ideal is primary to the ideal generated by the indeterminates
multiplicity of the ideal = 15

rank of class group = 1
class group is free
