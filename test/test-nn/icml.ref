5 Hilbert basis elements
5 lattice points in polytope (Hilbert basis elements of degree 1)
3 generators of integral closure of the ideal
4 extreme rays
4 support hyperplanes

embedding dimension = 3
rank = 3 (maximal)
external index = 1
internal index = 1
original monoid is integrally closed in chosen lattice

size of partial triangulation   = 0
resulting sum of |det|s = 0

grading:
1 1 -2 

degrees of extreme rays:
1:4  

Hilbert basis elements are of degree 1

ideal is not primary to the ideal generated by the indeterminates
