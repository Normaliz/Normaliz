6 Hilbert basis elements
6 lattice points in polytope (Hilbert basis elements of degree 1)
4 generators of integral closure of the ideal
4 extreme rays
4 support hyperplanes

embedding dimension = 3
rank = 3 (maximal)
external index = 1
internal index = 1
original monoid is integrally closed in chosen lattice

size of triangulation   = 4
resulting sum of |det|s = 4

grading:
1 1 -2 

degrees of extreme rays:
1: 4  

Hilbert basis elements are of degree 1

multiplicity = 4

ideal is primary to the ideal generated by the indeterminates
multiplicity of the ideal = 9
