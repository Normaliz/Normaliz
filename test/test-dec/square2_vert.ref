9 lattice points in polytope (module generators)
0 Hilbert basis elements of recession monoid
4 vertices of polyhedron
0 extreme rays of recession cone
4 support hyperplanes of polyhedron (homogenized)

embedding dimension = 3
affine dimension of the polyhedron = 2 (maximal)
rank of recession monoid = 0 (polyhedron is polytope)
internal index = 1

size of triangulation   = 3
resulting sum of |det|s = 8

dehomogenization:
0 0 1 


module rank = 9
volume (lattice normalized) = 8
volume (Euclidean) = 4
