4 extreme rays
4 support hyperplanes

embedding dimension = 3
rank = 3 (maximal)
external index = 1
internal index = 1

size of triangulation   = 4
resulting sum of |det|s = 4

grading:
1 1 -2 

degrees of extreme rays:
1:4  

multiplicity = 4

ideal is primary to the ideal generated by the indeterminates
multiplicity of the ideal = 9
