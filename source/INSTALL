*********************
**** PREPARATION ****
*********************

The compilation of Normaliz requires some c++11 features, supported by:

	gcc 4.4, clang 2.9, icc 12.0

See https://github.com/Normaliz/Normaliz/issues/26 for a more detailed discussion.

For compiling Normaliz the following libraries are needed:

* gmp with gmpxx
* boost (headers only)
* openmp enabled compiler (to use parallelization)

On Ubuntu the following packages should be installed:

	sudo apt-get install g++ libgmp-dev libboost-dev cmake cmake-curses-gui

The last two are only needed if cmake is to be used for building Normaliz.

On Fink (Mac OS X):

	fink install boost1.58-nopython

We offer three ways of compilation, either use:

* standard autotools (./configure && make && make install)
* cmake -- cmake is also capable of generating compile instructions 
       for other systems, like MS VS projects, etc.
* plain old makefile (Makefile.classic)

The basic steps are the same for all three systems:

* configuration
* compilation
* installation

The main difference is the way how the build system is configured.
 
 
*************************
*** Optional packages ***
*************************

As discussed in the manual, Normaliz can profit from the use of SCIP. If you want
to use it, SCIP must be installed before the compilation of Normaliz, independently of
the method used for building Normaliz.
 
To build SCIP:

* download the scipoptsuite at http://scip.zib.de/ . 

   Notice that SCIP
   is not distributed under GPL, but the ZIB Academic License
   (http://scip.zib.de/academic.txt).
   
* Unpack it and then compile it with
 
   make ZLIB=false GMP=false READLINE=false scipoptlib
   
   (To compiling scip for 32bit systems, add also ARCH=x86 to the make.)
   If your C++ compiler is too old, you may need to add
   CXXFLAGS="-std=c++0x -fPIC"
   
* IMPORTANT: ** Don't try to build scipopt as a shared library!  It does not work
      because their build system is broken **
   
Another optional package is CoCoALib, but only to the extent to that NmzIntegrate
is otional. If you want to compile NmzIntegrate, CoCoALib must be installed rfirst:

* download CoCoAlib from http://cocoa.dima.unige.it/cocoalib/,
* configure it with the threadsafe-hack, and compile:

	mkdir ~/CoCoA/
	cd ~/CoCoA/
	wget http://cocoa.dima.unige.it/cocoalib/tgz/CoCoALib-0.99540.tgz
	tar xvf CoCoALib-0.99540.tgz
	cd CoCoALib-0.99540
	./configure --threadsafe-hack
	make library -j2

If CoCoALib-0.99540 is no longer available, replace it by a newer version.

*******************
**** AUTOTOOLS ****
*******************

If you checked out normaliz from GitHub, first set up the autotools
system (./bootstrap.sh) -- in this case, the system needs to have
autoconf, automake, libtool installed.  This step is not necessary if
you started from a normaliz distribution.

We assume that you are in the directory in which source, doc etc. are subdirectories.

The first step is to configure the compilation. The simplest choice is

   ./configure
   
This is sufficient if you don't want SCIP and NmzIntegrate, provided libraries such
as GMP and Boost are in standard locations. If not, you must infrom configure where to 
find them:

  ./configure CPPFLAGS="-I /path/to/includedir" LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/libdir"
  
To configure normaliz to use the scipoptsuite compiled as above use:

   ./configure --with-scipoptsuite-src=/path/to/scipoptsuite-source-dir
   
Similarly, it may be necessary to show configure the path to CoCoALib if you want
to compile NmzIntegrate:

   ./configure --with-cocoalib=$HOME/CoCoA/CoCoALib-0.99540

Some more configure options:

* Static build (easier for debugging):

   ./configure --disable-shared
   
* Prefix (directory) for installation (default is /usr/local):

   ./configure --prefix=$HOME/normaliz
   
For more, see

   ./configure --help
   
After configuration we compile. Simply say

    make
    
This will compile normaliz, libnormaliz, nmzIntegrate and maxsimplex, 
the example program in the manual.

and then (if you want)

    make install
    
This will install normaliz, nmzIntegrate, the libraries and header files in their chosen
location (usr/local by default).

***************
**** CMAKE ****
***************

This has better capabilities to find libraries and allowa to change settings with a nice interface. Furthermore it supports the compilation of the library as static and dynamic version, installation of the library.

We assume you start in the normaliz root dir (with subdirs source, examples, ...).

[1] Create a build directory where normaliz will be build and cd into it, e.g.

	mkdir BUILD; cd BUILD

[2] Initial configuration, have a look at the next sections for further config infos.
(can be skipped if step [3] is done, but it shows some information about what compiler, libraries, etc. it uses)

	cmake ../source

[3] (Optional) Check configuration and perhaps change some settings:

	ccmake ../source
	
In the ccmake interface you can use this workflow:
* c  (for configure)
* change entries if you like, then press c again
* g  (generate and exit)

[4] compile

	make
	
This make includes dependency checks and other nice features.
If you want to see what happens behind the scenes use

	make VERBOSE=1

[5] install it

	make install

This will install the produced libnormaliz, the header files for it  and the normaliz executable. The path can be changed with ccmake (CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX).

NOTE: nmzIntegrate is not (yet) included in the cmake build system for Normaliz. 
See the NmzIntegrate manual for the use of the plain make file of NmzIntegrate.


**** ADDITIONAL CMAKE CONFIGURATION ****

If you want to override system defaults you can change values with ccmake or set enviroment variables.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Be aware that some of these only work with the first call of cmake. If you want to change it later clean your build directory first, or use another fresh build directory.

Some examples:

* Specifiy installation location:

	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$HOME/local ../source   (default is /usr/local)

* Different compiler:

	CC=gcc-4 CXX=g++-4  cmake  ../source/

* To specify search paths for GMP you can add before the cpmmand cmake

	GMP_DIR=/path/to/gmp     
	
It will look inside for subfolders with the headers and lib.
If this is not successfull you can specify the paths seperatly:

	GMP_INC_DIR=/path/to/include  (for headers)
	GMP_LIB_DIR=/path/to/lib     (for libs)

To use your own GMP version installed to the 'local' folder in the home directory use

	GMP_DIR=$HOME/local/   cmake   ../source/

For MacOS you can set CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES eigther with the cmake command-line option

	-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64
	
or by setting it in ccmake to x86_64.

Also the  Boost directories can be specified:

BOOST_ROOT                 - Preferred installation prefix
BOOST_INCLUDEDIR           - Preferred include directory e.g. <prefix>/include
BOOST_LIBRARYDIR           - Preferred library directory e.g. <prefix>/lib
Boost_NO_SYSTEM_PATHS      - Set to ON to disable searching in locations not
                             specified by these hint variables. Default is OFF.
Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS  - List of Boost versions not known to this module
                             (Boost install locations may contain the version)
							 
See http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/git-master/module/FindBoost.html


**** CMAKE: Using SCIP ****

Then configure Normaliz with, for example,

  SCIP_DIR=$HOME/scipoptsuite-3.2.0/ cmake ../source/ -DNMZ_SCIP=ON

Currently our cmake module to find scip only supports versions 3.1.1 and 3.2.0
on Linux 32 and 64 bit and MacOs X.


**** CMAKE: Build for Intel Xeon Phi Mic ****

This section describes how to compile Normaliz with support for offloading to Intel Xeon Phi. Only the Intel compiler supports this offload.

First you need (as usual) the libraries boost and gmp. The libgmp and libgmpxx must be compiled twice, once for the host and once for the target-architecture of the mic. You will probably not find a compiled version for the mic, so we recommend to compile both yourself. Download the gmp sources and extract them.

The following description is based on gmp 6.0.0 and icc 15.0.2

Compile GMP with icc:

	cd gmp-6.0.0
	mkdir BUILD_native
	cd BUILD_native
	CC=icc CXX=icpc ../configure --enable-cxx --prefix=$HOME/local/
	make
	make install

Compile gmp with icc for the mic:

	cd gmp-6.0.0
	mkdir BUILD_mic
	cd BUILD_mic
	CC=icc CXX=icpc CFLAGS="-mmic" CXXFLAGS="-mmic" LDFLAGS="-mmic" ../configure --host=x86_64-k1om-linux  --enable-cxx --disable-assembly --prefix=$HOME/mic_local/
	make
	make install

The intel compiler had problems with User-defined literals from c++11, so we had to comment out some lines (1925-1944) in $HOME/local/include/gmpxx.h and the same for the mic dir.

Now we are ready to compile Normaliz:

	cd normaliz
	mkdir BUILD_OFFLOAD
	cd BUILD_OFFLOAD
	CC=icc CXX=icpc GMP_DIR=$HOME/local MIC_GMP_DIR=$HOME/mic_local BOOST_ROOT=$HOME/boost_1_57_0 cmake -DNMZ_MIC_OFFLOAD=ON ../source/
	make

If you get an error saying it cannot find boost/dynamic_bitset.hpp or similar, try to set BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR directly to a path which is not a system default path (e.g. by using "ccmake ." after the first configuration.)

For running the executable you also have to set the MIC_LD_LIBRARY_PATH, e.g. by an entry in the .profile

    if [ $HOSTNAME == 'phi' ] ; then	#only on the system with mics
        export     LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/local/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        export MIC_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/mic_local/lib/:$MIC_LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    fi


If you want to compile Normaliz for running it NATIVELY on the Phi, give
 
	CC=icc CXX=icpc GMP_DIR=$HOME/mic_local BOOST_ROOT=$HOME/boost_1_57_0 cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-mmic ../source/


**** CMAKE: Build NmzIntegrate ****

Not yet possible. After haveing built Normaliz, navigate to source/genEhrhart and run make.

********************
**** plain MAKE ****
********************

You can still use our old simple plain Makefile. But the autotools and CMAKE configurations are much more powerful.

1) Go to the source directory

2) Check the configuration, in Makefile.configuration, especially the locations of
the optional packages and their versions.

3) Say 

	make -f Makefile.classic
	
It should work without change of Makefile.classic or Makefile.configuration on many systems
that have a system installation of the needed libraries. (We must use the name Makefile.claasic since Makefile is occupied by autotools.)

4) For NmzIntegrate now say 

	make -f Makefile.classic nmzIntegrate 

If everything is successful, then the executable files normaliz and nmzIntegrate are both 
in the source directory. You may of course want to move them somewhere else. Don't forget 
that the cooperation of normaliz and nmzIntegrate requires that both are in the same directory.

Similarly

	make -f Makefile.classic maxsimplex
	
for the compilation of maxsimplex (example for the use of libnormaliz
in the manial).

5) If you want to install Normaliz, Say 

	make -f Makefile.classic install

This make accepts two optional arguments (also simultaneously):

	make -f Makefile.classic OPENMP=no  # deactivates OpenMP
	make -f Makefile.classic SCIP=yes   # compile with SCIP

You must make sure that everything is compiled with the same set of options!
In doubt use make clean before.

NOTE: If Normaliz was built with SCIP=yes, you must add this option also if you make nmzIntegrate
and maxsimplex.
