Macaulay2 distributes a version of the Normaliz interface. To use it just start
M2 and do
    loadPackage "Normaliz";


Instructions to use another version:

* Start M2 from the directory where your Normaliz.m2 is located.
* Run
    installPackage "Normaliz";
  twice! (The second run updates some references.)
  This will load the package, run the examples, create the manual,
  and install everything to the users local Macaulay directory
  (e.g. ~/.Macaulay2/)
* Now it is installed locally and every consecutive
    loadPackage "Normaliz";
  will load this version.

Additional instructions for developers:

* Run the tests:
    loadPackage "Normaliz";
    check "Normaliz"

* If you change Normaliz.m2, a new installPackage will still use an earlier
  installed version from your local Macalauy2 directory. You can delete this
  directory to be sure that everything is remade.
* For development it might be convenient to have the package NOT installed but
  only re-load it after a change and run the tests via
    loadPackage ("Normaliz", Reload => true);
    check "Normaliz"
